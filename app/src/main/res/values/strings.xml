    <string name="project_description">
        This app has been developep for luthiers, musicians and hobbyists looking for precision when calculating fret measurements for stringed instruments such
        as guitars, requintos, and string bass. Our goal is to facilitate the design and construction of custom instruments with a practical and reliable tool.
